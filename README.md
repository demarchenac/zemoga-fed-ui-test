## B.E.M.

I followed the [Block Element Modifier (BEM)](https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/) methodology in order to create the styles of the static site.

I defined the folder structure for the styles following the principles from [Sass Guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture)
